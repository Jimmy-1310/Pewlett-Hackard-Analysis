# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview

The porpouse of this project was to organaize and update the csv files of "Pewlett-Hackard" into an SQL database. In order to set-up the database, an ERD was created. This will help the company understand their database and how tables relate to each other, and make any future queries to gather data. Once this database was setted-up the company had a question to answer, How many employees are retiring? In order to answer this question, tables were created to provide useful insight, not only on the ammount of total retiring employees but also their tittle and the ammount of retiriments by department. 

For this project I learned how to create an ERD of a database, to fully understand the relation each table had with each other. I used Postgres and PgAdmin to develop and customize the database with the csv files provided. Lastly, I used queries to create and gather specific data to then add it to a new table and export that table into a new csv file.
